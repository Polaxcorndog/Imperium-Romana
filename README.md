Battle of Manzikert 26 August 1071
Adronikos takes a stray arrow
The Emperor was surrounded by the Seljuk, and almost captured. When everything was at its dire end for the emperor. But, all was not lost when Nikephoros Bryennios bashed the Seljuk line with his elite guard of Tagmata Calvary. Managed to rescue the emperor, but noticing that the emperor was mortally wounded. Nikephoros a general better than any man on the field, knew that if this news got circulating all was lost. He pulled the emperor of the field, and returned to lead the battle. Nikephoros’s leadership was unmatched, and was able to lead the men to an ultimate victory crushing the Seljuk.
Alp Arsian was cut down with the majority of the Seljuk army. This left the Seljuk Empire in disarray. With a large majority of the army lost, and leaderless. The Seljuks will surely not last.
After the battle the Romans had prevailed, and pursuing the routing forces of the Seljuk. Soon after the reigning Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes died from wounds at the heroic victory at Manzikert. There are accounts of his son Constantine Diogenes being located in Antioch defending against Muslim forces. Nikephoros Bryennios gathers his remaining forces and heads south in search of the new Emperor.

Battle of Antioch 12 September 1071
Nikephoros’s arrival to Antioch, was a sight for sore eyes. The defenders of Antioch poured out to charge the besiegers, while Nikephoros’s Army charged from behind. The Battle was a decisive Roman Victory, and the Seljuks were in full retreat. Although the Romans could pursue, but the current standing of the empire needed to be resolved. 
Unfortunately Romano’s only known son was killed in a previous engagement, and now the empire is left with no legitimate heir. Nikephoros Bryennios realizes that this is a very dangerous situation, a power vacuum of this magnitude at the current state of the Empire could be devastating. He marches to Constantinople with his loyal army.
