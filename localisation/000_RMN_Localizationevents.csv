EVTNAME5435;Cilician Border Conflicts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5435;The Rum to the north are easy to raid, we are well supported by the Romans. We should push further into their territory, and see what more we could take.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME5436;The Cilician Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90076;Cilicia has been a blemish on our pride for some time. Now that the opportunity presents itself, and Rum mastery over Anatolia is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Ciliacians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Cilician lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT5436OPTA;Rum will show its might!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT5436OPTB;We are willing to negotiate a settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME5437;Negotiations with the Rum;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC5437;While we expected immediate Rum reprisal, it seems our enemies are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: accept the territories that we want, and allow Rum to rule over us. Of course this would avoid a great deal of bloodshed, but the Romans might not be so happy about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT5437OPTA;We agree to the proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT5437OPTB;Never! We reject all Rum influence in Cilia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
